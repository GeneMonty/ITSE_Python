# MichiganCities.py - This program prints a message for invalid cities in Michigan.  
# Input:  Interactive
# Output:  Error message or nothing

# Initialized list of cities
citiesInMichigan = ["Acme", "Albion", "Detroit", "Watervliet", "Coloma", "Saginaw", "Richland", "Glenn", "Midland", "Brooklyn"] 

# Get user input
inCity = input("Enter name of city: ")


# Write your test statement here to see if there is a match.

# If the city is found, print "City found."

# Otherwise, "Not a city in Michigan" message should be printed. 








# Searching a List for an Exact Match

# Summary
        # In this lab, you use what you have learned about searching a list to find an exact match to complete a partially prewritten Python program.

        # The program uses a list that contains valid names for 10 cities in Michigan. You ask the user to enter a city name; your program then searches the list for that city name. If it is not found, the program should print a message that informs the user the city name is not found in the list of valid cities in Michigan.

        # The starter file provided for this lab includes input statements. You need to write code to examine all the items in the list and test for a match. You also need to determine if you should print the "Not a city in Michigan." message.

# Comments in the code tell you where to write your statements.

# Instructions
        # Study the prewritten code to make sure you understand it.
        # Write a loop statement that examines the names of cities stored in the list.
        # Write code that tests for a match.
        # Write code that, when appropriate, prints the message "Not a city in Michigan.".
        # Execute the program using the following as input:
        # Chicago
        # Brooklyn
        # Watervliet
        # Acme
